            You must be wondering why this website is so simple and barebones. <br>
            During my earlier years where I was interested in investing, I used to visit alot of company websites for information. However, none surprised me more than <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway's website</a>.
            <br>
            It was simple, clean, and easy to navigate. <br>
            <br>
            Amongst other reasons, I wanted to challenge myself to create a website without using any modern frameworks and as a 1999 kid, I wanted to pay homage to the old school websites. <br>
            I hope you like it! And if you don't, maybe <a href="https://thesiswhisperer.com/2019/02/27/whatever-happened-to-the-academic-home-page/">others</a> can convince you otherwise.
