                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Europe has always fascinated me with its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant cultures.
                    In early 2026, I finally had the chance to explore some of its iconic cities and hidden gems.
                </p>

                <h2>The Trip</h2>
                <h3>Preparing</h3>
                <p>
                    Every trip starts at home. Good preparation, like in many areas of life, can go a long way, and this is no
                    exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before a trip, I always check the weather first. I learned from experience never to underestimate
                    nature. Despite advancements in our civilization, it is still a force to be reckoned with.

                    Nowadays, it's very easy to do this with built-in apps on our phones that give surprisingly accurate information.
                    Luckily, the weather was in the same temperature/wind speed range as my winter experience in America. Cold, but at least 
                    I knew exactly how cold and could use the proven gear I already had.

                    Unfortunately, I prioritize comfort or perhaps in this case, survival over fashion and ended up looking like 
                    this.

                <p>
                    Pack too light and you suffer but pack too much and you also suffer. Unfortunately, most of the time,
                    you have to go through <a href="https://americanliterature.com/childrens-stories/goldilocks-and-the-three-bears" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</a> to find the right balance.
                    Personally, I like to wear jeans. They're tough against the elements and don't need frequent washing. And dry-fit shirts are an absolute hack. They dry super fast, making washing super convenient. You can practically shower with your clothes on if you have to, hang them on a chair
                    to dry, and by morning you can wear them again without wrinkles.
                    When it comes to undergarments, however, this is where I don't skimp. Hygiene is key to not falling sick.

                <h3>Budapest, Hungary</h3>
                <div>
                    <img src="../imgs/Budapest.jpeg" alt="Budapest cityscape">

                <p>
                    I started my journey in Budapest. Not gonna lie, the first sight was graffiti. I usually don't like
                    talking about politics, but it's clear the country's infrastructure has not recovered from its communist/revolution 
                    past. Even deep into Budapest, graffiti is a common sight. Then again, they have really nice cars. 
                    Teslas as taxis shocked me. The sight of sleek Mercedes and BMWs contrasts deeply with the worn
                    roads—a puzzling observation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decided to drop by Széchenyi Spa at night for an outdoor bath in the freezing winter. Side note: please bring your 
                    own slippers, they're required, although I saw someone getting away with socks. Paying $20 for a pair of subpar 
                    slippers that I could easily get for $1 elsewhere was a painful experience.

                    <p>
                        The bath was nice, although too crowded for my taste. Attempted to avoid peak hours, but due to flight delays,
                        it couldn't be helped. At least I got some nice night pictures.

                    The next day, mostly hung around the Castle Hill area for the scenery and historical landmarks.

                    The architecture was beautiful, but maintenance seems to be an issue, with some parts undergoing major reconstruction.
                    I heard from a local that it's been like this for a long time, sadly.

                    A key highlight of Budapest has got to be this restaurant: SIMALIBA Belvárosi Csárda. Hands
                    down, the most pleasant culinary experience of this entire Europe trip. Great host, fantastic homey food.

                    My personal favorite is their venison stew with traditional potato dumplings, but they're more known
                    for their goose. The flavor profile was refreshingly unique to my Asian taste buds.

                    From there, the next stop was Vienna, which is convenient to travel via trains from Budapest Keleti to 
                    Vienna Central Station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not gonna lie, I had some trouble navigating the trains initially. Most of the trouble was due to my inexperience
                    with European train systems. Apparently, once you buy your tickets, you can just hop on the trains. I was more accustomed to gantries
                    and a bit more organization, but here you simply board the train, and attendants will come by during the 
                    ride to scan your tickets, which are usually in the form of QR codes. Sadly, the information counter attendants
                    were less than helpful with this simple information due to language barrier and genuine apathy. Thankfully, I randomly 
                    asked a British guy who kindly explained everything to me.

                    Traveling on holidays in Europe is probably something that sounds good on paper... until you
                    realize that work-life balance is really important in Europe. Almost nothing is open on Christmas Eve.
                    And I mean it. Not even McDonald's, which is my gold standard. Very different compared to my time in New York. 
                    But at least I got to experience the Christmas market which was bustling with hot mulled wine and bratwurst.

                    In Vienna, the highlight has got to be the history. I spent time visiting the Innere Stadt area. There are
                    a lot of museums. Unfortunately, most of them require tickets that are in high demand. I would not rely 
                    on same day online booking, but thankfully most museums seem to reserve some tickets for physical counters,
                    so as long as you show up early, you can still get in. Museums here seem to divide the day into time slots
                    for crowd control so that everyone can have an enjoyable experience. If you're a big fan of history,
                    consider getting the Vienna City Pass.

                    I would definitely recommend the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/state-hall-of-the-austrian-national-library-austrian-national-library/pAUhvxBkUWnhIQ?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Hall of the Austrian National Library</a>.
                    During my time there, I found the "Medicine through the Ages" exhibition really interesting, but the 
                    exhibitions rotate from time to time, so check them out beforehand <a href="https://www.onb.ac.at/en/museums/state-hall/programme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

                    I visited Belvedere Palace, but there were only tickets available for Lower Belvedere. Truth be told, the gardens were a disappointment.
                    Winter had frozen the water fountains and the plants didn't look as vibrant as in Google Images. Exhibitions in Lower Belvedere were okay
                    but not really worth the time and money.

                    Luckily, Schönbrunn Palace was much better. It goes at length about the lives of the Habsburgs, and the history there did not fail to 
                    entertain. Its gardens are massive, and there's even a zoo nearby. You can definitely spend a few hours here.

                    I enjoyed the local coffee culture as well, which seems to be very popular—mile-long queues for cafes are a
                    common sight. It was fascinating to see how history and modern life coexist seamlessly here.

                    There were more places I visited spontaneously. Truth be told, there wasn't much planning in Vienna, but I still
                    found that navigating through these places wasn't especially troublesome unless you want to experience the Opera House or
                    concerts, which I highly suggest you plan ahead for and ask lots of questions about beforehand.

                    Fun fact: The wall behind the Soviet War Memorial has a large Ukrainian flag painted on it, which to me shows how complex history
                    can become. The past stays the same, but how we see it doesn't.

                    Prague was surprisingly pleasant. To be honest, I liked it more than Vienna's streets. It had more vibrant shopping streets
                    and things just felt more fairytale-like, with medieval charm.

                    One of my favorite things in Prague was the Fashion Arena Prague Outlet.

                    There were a lot of shops selling merchandise. I practically jumped at
                    a pair of Nike Air Jordans 1 mid for a really good price of ~SGD$79. To give a reference, the exact same model in Switzerland 
                    would cost about ~SGD$269. I even considered getting a leather jacket to look like a motorcycle rider but decided against
                    it since it's impractical in Singapore's hot climate.

                    Although there weren't many museums, I still found Prague to be really well balanced between shopping and attractions. 
                    If you had to visit one city alone, I would suggest Prague. 
                    Side note: Prague's old town shopping streets actually stayed open late into the night.
                    In almost all the other cities I visited, shops close around 6 PM sharp, so this was a pleasant surprise.

                <h3>Zurich, Switzerland: Where I Felt Broke</h3>
                <p>
                    My least favorite place on this trip. Every purchase felt like losing an arm and a leg. There's no escape.
                    The public transport is expensive, the food is expensive, the souvenirs are expensive.

                    I'll never come back here again unless it's to climb Jungfraujoch or visit for the chocolate.

                <p>
                    As much praise as there is for the engineering of Swiss public transportation, I did not enjoy its administrative side.
                    I would suggest doing as much research as you can beforehand because mistakes are costly unless you decide to buy the Swiss Travel Pass.

                    For example, when traveling to see Rhine Falls from Zurich, Google Maps is normally the go to. It recommended a route to 
                    Neuhausen Rheinfall station, which is in another region called Schaffhausen. But if you just cross the bridge to Schloss Laufen station, it's 
                    still under the Zurich district, which allows you to continue using day passes like the 9 O'Clock Day Pass without any additional
                    charge. From my experience with regional lines, there's almost always a train attendant to check tickets. If you have the wrong ticket, a nice
                    attendant will sell you a ticket on the spot. Otherwise, it's a 100 CHF fine.

                <p>
                    I would highly suggest reading a travel pamphlet given to you by your hotel or Airbnb, or just grabbing one from the information counters.
                    For some reason, despite trying to do some last minute online research while waiting for baggage, I couldn't find information
                    that was particularly helpful. But after carefully reading the pamphlet from my hotel for 15 minutes on a train ride, I understood it much better.
                    That was just my experience, though perhaps I didn't find good guides online. You may have better luck.

                    I'm sure the Swiss have put much thought into their transportation services, and it is intuitive once you get the hang of it. Nonetheless,
                    unless you have money to solve problems or are super attentive 100% of the time, as a first time traveler you should expect some hiccups 
                    and reserve some extra money. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Swiss Alps were definitely the highlight. They are breathtakingly amazing.
                    Transportation here was definitely worth every penny. Although I didn't have the time to travel deep into the Alps, the transportation
                    network seems very extensive, and you can get pretty far for some amazing views.
                    I'd still suggest preparing beforehand with waterproof boots with spikes, a good pair of windproof gloves, 
                    earmuffs or a beanie, and sunglasses.

                    Despite the cost, I'd suggest paragliding. The views are spectacular. A word of advice, probably only relevant to myself: 
                    to make it worth your while, try looking into the camera more often, despite the tempting views.

                    The Lindt chocolate factory is another key highlight. The queue was long, so I highly suggest booking in advance if you can.
                    The chocolate tour was quite worth the price, especially since you can get as many samples as you want. Although
                    everyone else wants them too, so realistically you'll get to try things once or twice unless you're super patient with the queues.

                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <p>
                    This Europe trip was not just about visiting places, but also about observing how people live, work,
                    and interact with their environment. From architecture to public transportation, and even the way
                    coffee shops are designed, I found inspiration in a vastly different culture and way of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue exploring new cities and cultures, bringing back experiences and perspectives
                    that make both my life and my projects richer.
