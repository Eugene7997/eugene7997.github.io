                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I consider myself a lazy person. That's how I got pulled into tech.
                    The ability to automate things piqued my interest.
                    One of the first programming books I ever picked up was "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
                    The idea that you could automate away dull, repetitive tasks felt like a superpower.
                    Playing around with code to optimise my day to day work was part curiousity,
                    part puzzle solving but definitely at the end of the day when the
                    workflow worked, fulfilment from the amount of time saved was worth it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a similar vein, nowadays every morning, when I sit down to work, I face the frictions
                    in my workflow.
                    First-world problems that derail focus and momentum. After enough procrastination, I finally
                    decided to do something about it.
                </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    Mouse.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The mouse is like who Jerry is to Tom. I need Jerry, who usually means well but is constantly
                        interrupting me. Every time I reach for it, my momentum collapses. I'm dragging a tiny arrow
                        around the screen hoping it lands exactly where I want. Sure it works but it's clumsy, slow,
                        and just fussy enough to annoy me.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><code>cd</code> overload.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Life just has too many folders, too many keystrokes, and way too much typing just
                        to navigate around. Too many times, I have closed terminals to avoid cluttering
                        my window space, only to realise that I need them again. Then comes the cycle of
                        <code>cd</code>s and <code>ls</code>s.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Tiling annoyance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I am somewhat of an particular person. If I see an imperfection, it just ticks me. Especially,
                        window tiling. Combine that with tiling with a mouse? Mama mia.
                        Although there is the built-in Windows tiling which has come a long way, its just not for me.
                        It still doesn't feel snappy and hands-off enough.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lack of quick access.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lack of quick access in windows. I constantly open the same tools, files, and utilities, yet
                        jump through hoops every time.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    Now I mostly use Windows. While I have been a long time user of linux, I am just too lazy to deal
                    with
                    hardware problems and I want to run my commerical applications without any hassle. So most stuff I
                    am
                    going to talk about is for Windows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I have mentioned I'm a keyboard person. I don't like using mouse if I can help
                    with it It's not that the mouse is bad.
                    It's just slow, needs precision / fiddly. Especially inconvenient on a laptop or when moving around.
                    The context switching between my mouse and keyboard also kicks me out of the zone sometimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, mouse is extremely useful and a vital tool. I just want to reduce not replace.
                    And where do I most use the mouse? Browsing the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vimium instantly became a must-have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am blown away by how useful it has been for me.
                    Having sensible keyboard bindings to navigate through the web has reduced my need for the
                    mouse by about 70%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am able navigate through pages, select and copy text, switch tabs back and forth easily and even open a search bar 
                    for specific selection instead of cycling through the tabs. I can go back and forth in my page
                    history. All this without touching my mouse.

                    I am a heavy user of desktop panel switching. Despite improvements
                    in tiling in windows 11. I am still just too lazy. I want it
                    automated and snappy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honestly, GlazeWM works well enough. The latency is sometimes noticeable
                    but still quite snappy. It met all my tiling needs, panels to seggregate
                    windows, auto tile windows, resizing, moving and fullscreen toggling.

                    This is a game changer. The accessibility and configuration
                    freedom has reduce much of the friction I face in my workflows.
                    Flow Launcher acts as a universal
                    command palette for Windows, allowing me to interact with my system almost
                    entirely from the keyboard. I can instantly launch applications, search files, run system
                    commands, and perform calculations with a single shortcut. It's plugin ecosystem allows
                    me to control windows, search the web, execute shell commands, translate text, 
                    manage clipboard history, and even trigger custom scripts, all without leaving my current context.

                    and files easily especially with features like preview, fzf, 
                    multi-tab support.
                    In addition, the vim-like keybindings which lets me do 
                    file management easily, avoiding the need for default file managers
                    like windows explorer, reducing number of windows I have to manage.

                    Was tired to having to switch between terminals when
                    switching between linux and windows machines. Different
                    configurations, different key bindings frustrated me.
                    But now, I can re-use my configurations across linux,
                    windows platforms with very few changes.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Are these the best tools? Tools a hardcore linux enthusast
                    would use? Nah, not by a long shot. For my linux machines I used
                    better alternatives like i3wm.
                    But they are easy to install without much hassle and it does the 
                    job well enough. 
                    I simply don't have all the time to optimise it to high heavens. 
                    Sometimes, its about getting your foot in first and slowly finding 
                    your way to paradise. After all, the main priority is doing the work. 
                    It's important not to lose sight of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made sure to keep the list short. Let's be honest, attention spans
                    aren't exactly thriving these days. But there are so many more tools
                    that are so helpful and the fun part about being a software engineer
                    is exploring and being dazzled by them.
